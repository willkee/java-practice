ArrayList

- class in the collections API in Java
- creates an array and provides methods for working with it
	default size: 16
- The size of the array is mutable
- Grows 50% larger to accommodate more elements once it reaches capacity
- allows duplicates
- order of insertion is preserved

Creates new array with 50% more space, copy previous array

Array is a continuous block of memory. Linked list is not.

Linked List
- class in Collections API
- Linear series of Nodes
	- node wraps up a value (String, Pizza, etc)
- linked by a reference to the next node
- doubly-linked; previous and next reference
- allows duplicates
- preserves order

Queue
- interface in collections API
- first in first out
- push to tail
- pop from head

Stack
- class in collections API
- first in last out
- push to tail
- pop from tail
- allows duplicates
- order is preserved

HashMap
- class in collections API stores key-value pairs
- key is used to identify value
- SSN maps to a US Citizen
- keys must be unique, no restriction on values
- putting a value with the same key updates the value for that key
- underneath, hashMaps stores "entry" objects in an array
- object's hashCode helps calculate the array index to store it in
- hashMap collisions occur when the calculation for 2 indexes have the same value
	- appends the entry to a LinkedList


hashSet
- class in Collections API
- stores unique objects
- order not guaranteed
- no index available
- stores values inside of a hashMap

set.add("Dan");

First Normal Form
- no repeating groups (multi-valued column)
	only one value per column
	
Table must define a primary key
	- a unique identified for a row

Given a data set, you find candidate keys
	- a reasonable choice for a primary key
	- surrogate key for a order number or student Id. must be unique
	

Second Normal Form
- Functional Dependence
	- one value determines another
	- Your birthday determines your age
	- Order number determines the date the order was placed
	- First name does not determine anything
	- Example:
		- Order 1, line 1, line 2, line 3 etc.
		- Order 2, line 1
		- Order 3, line 1
		
	Order date needs to be another table associated only with order number
		- foreign key to order lines table containing line numbers
		
- No partial dependencies

- Composite key
	- two or more column primary key

		
Third Normal Form
- No Transitive Dependencies
	a column determined by a non-key attribute
	
	includes derived attributes, which should be calculated (not stored in DB)
		- example: birthday determines age
			- item price * quantity = line total
			- sum of line total = sub-total
			
		- have a separate table for items to contain descriptions
		- in 3NF, there is a table with nothing but keys

"The Key" "The Whole Key" "Nothing But The Key" "So Help Me Codd"
1NF            2NF               3NF                     BCNF (Boyce-Codd)
