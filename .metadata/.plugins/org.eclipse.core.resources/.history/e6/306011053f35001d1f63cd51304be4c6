Java is a strongly-typed language
need to specify a specific data type for each variable

Primitive data types:
- Numeric (whole)
- Numeric (decimal)
- Text
- True/false


(types: byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean)

- non-primitive data types:
- any class you want, you may create your own types
- string: multiple characters together

Arrays
- stores multiple values in a single reference variable
- store in a continuous (sequential) block of memory
- Access elements by index
- Values must be the same data type

Methods

- method signature is the method name and parameters

public void go() {}       object.go();
public void go (int speed) {}       object.go(100);

// Method overloading is using the same method name with different parameters

Static methods are called without an object:

Math.random();
Math.pow(2, 31);
Math.tan(90);

Methods with non-void return type must have a return statement
