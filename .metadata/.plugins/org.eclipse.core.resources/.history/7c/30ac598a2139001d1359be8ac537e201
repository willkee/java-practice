ArrayList

- class in the collections API in Java
- creates an array and provides methods for working with it
	default size: 16
- The size of the array is mutable
- Grows 50% larger to accommodate more elements once it reaches capacity
- allows duplicates
- order of insertion is preserved

Creates new array with 50% more space, copy previous array

Array is a continuous block of memory. Linked list is not.

Linked List
- class in Collections API
- Linear series of Nodes
	- node wraps up a value (String, Pizza, etc)
- linked by a reference to the next node
- doubly-linked; previous and next reference
- allows duplicates
- preserves order

Queue
- interface in collections API
- first in first out
- push to tail
- pop from head

Stack
- class in collections API
- first in last out
- push to tail
- pop from tail
- allows duplicates
- order is preserved

HashMap
- class in collections API stores key-value pairs
- key is used to identify value
- SSN maps to a US Citizen
- keys must be unique, no restriction on values
- putting a value with the same key updates the value for that key
- underneath, hashMaps stores "entry" objects in an array
- object's hashCode helps calculate the array index to store it in
- hashMap collisions occur when the calculation for 2 indexes have the same value
	- appends the entry to a LinkedList


hashSet
- class in Collections API
- stores unique objects
- order not guaranteed
- no index available
- stores values inside of a hashMap

set.add("Dan");
